Sphinx plugin to add an HTTP domain, allowing the documentation of RESTful HTTP methods.

    .. http:method:: GET /api/foo/bar/:id/:slug

       :param id: An id
       :param slug: A slug

       Retrieve list of foobars matching given id.
       
This is very rudimentary and experimental code at the moment.

Drop http_domain.py into your Sphinx documentation source directory and enable/add the below settings in conf.py to use:

    # If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
    # add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
    # documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

    extensions = ['http_domain']
